# Heart Rate Prediction using reinforcement learning ( PPO & PPG-DaLiA )

A reinforcement learning model that predicts short-term heart rate using real-time physiological signals (ACC, RESP, TEMP, ACTIVITY, etc.) collected from wearable sensors. Trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the model learns to forecast the next 3 seconds of heart rate based on the previous 60 seconds of multimodal data.

## 📊 Features

- Uses PPO to optimize HR prediction
- Inputs: chest & wrist accelerometer, respiratory, activity, temperature
- Trait inputs (e.g., SPORT category) used as additional conditioning
- Predicts next 3 seconds of heart rate based on past 60 seconds
- Visualized prediction vs ground truth with animated plots
- Test/train split for evaluation

---

## 🧠 Model

The model uses an actor-critic architecture:

- **Input:** Past 60s of signal data + 5D traits vector
- **Output:** Predicted HR deltas for next 3s
- **Loss:** MSE between predicted and true HR values
- **Reward:** Negative of MSE (encouraging accuracy)

---

## 🖼 Visualization

Use interactive animations or GIFs to show:

- Last 60s of signal as context
- Predicted vs actual heart rate over next 3s
- Auto-updating plots (via Streamlit or Matplotlib)
